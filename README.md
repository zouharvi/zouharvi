### VilÃ©m/Vilda ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student at ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland supervised by Mrinmaya Sachan and Menna El-Assady.
I have a passion for natural language processing research, especially:
- NLG/MT evaluation (model-human communication, metrics, quality estimation, efficient evaluation)
- NLP-oriented human-computer interaction (confidence, annotations)

Let me know if you're interested in any of these topics!
